# Unofficial 75 HARD Tracker

## A project meant to help track the daily rules set forth in [Andy Frisella's 75 Hard Challenge](https://andyfrisella.com/pages/75hard-info)

This is unofficial 75 HARD application. [Here](https://andyfrisella.com/products/75-hard-app) you can find the Andy Frisella's official application.

75 HARD is marketed as a "transformative mental toughness program". During this program you will follow five simple rules everyday for 75 days. If you miss fail to complete your tasks you start over at day one. Here are the rules:

* Drink a gallon of water.
* Read 10 pages from a nonfiction self-improvement book (I love audiobooks too, but they don't count here!).
* Take a progress photo everyday.
* Choose a diet and stick to it. No alcohol and no cheat meals.
* Do two 45-minute workouts, atleast one has to be outdoors.

Upon completion of the 75 days you can expect improvement in many areas, like:

*Confidence
*Self-worth
*Time-management
*Perservance
